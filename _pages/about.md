Hi, I am Dharmendra Choudhary. I am passionate about Deep Learning and NLP. I am currently working as a Specialist Programmer at Infosys, Bangalore. I have started my journey with deep learning five years back in my college with computer vision and building production NLP products for Enterprises from last three years. I love to have a good discussion on Technology and love solving puzzles.
